# UAV Medical Supplies Delivery System

This project was developed as a graduation capstone to design and optimize a **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)**-based system for delivering medical supplies efficiently. It integrates optimization models, path planning, and system monitoring tools to simulate and manage UAV fleet operations in real time.

## Project Objective

To design and implement a cost-effective and scalable UAV delivery system for medical supplies by:
- Minimizing operational costs
- Maximizing fleet efficiency
- Ensuring real-time tracking and system control

---

## Key Features

- **Optimization Models**  
  - Fleet sizing, battery capacity, and maintenance scheduling to maximize profit and minimize cost

- **Path Planning Algorithm**  
  - Shortest-path generation for efficient route management

- **Real-Time System Monitoring GUI**  
  - Interactive desktop application for UAV tracking and operational control

- **Operations Management**  
  - Integrated scheduling and resource planning using ISDFAM (Itinerary-based Fleet Assignment Model)

---

## System Components

- **Fleet Optimization**: Linear programming models for resource usage and delivery time constraints  
- **Routing Algorithm**: Developed in Python/C++ (specify language used) for dynamic path computation  
- **Desktop Application**: Developed in C# for live system simulation and GUI control  
- **Simulation Dataset**: Based on real-world delivery distances, payload requirements, and timing constraints
